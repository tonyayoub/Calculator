# Calculator

A simple Calculator app iOS project using SwiftUI

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Advanced mathematical operations: sin, cos
- Online operation: Bitcoin
- Operations enabling and disabling
- Dark mode support

## Installation

Clone this repository and import into Xcode.

git clone https://github.com/tonyayoub/Calculator.git


## Usage

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Build and run the application on a simulator or physical device.

## Notes
- The unit tests are to deomonstrate the testability of the view model and the calculation handler. There are many more test cases to be added to cover all cases (for both calculations and layout management)

- The calculator is missing a frame around the buttons. This looks OK in iPhone because the screen edges act as a frame but in iPad it does not look good. The reason for the missing frame is that I had to put the feature toggling on the same view and couldn't figure out a nice design to not let them look like they are outside the main app.

- For Modularization, I used XCode project groups/folders for code hierarchy. As a future enhancement, I can create a Swift package for networking and another one for calculation handling. 

- Sin, Cos and Bitcoin are used by entering a value, then tapping the operation. 

- Errors are handled locally without reporting to an error management module.


## Roadmap and Future Enhancements

- Creating an additional display for previously entered values and operations
- Creating a central error handling mechanism.
- Creating a frame around the buttons grid and the display.
- Support for landscape mode.
- Creating a module for networking and calculation handling
- Using Xcode Cloud for CI
